The name Aktium comes after the latin word `Actio´, meaning action. That is before anything the initial spark that we need in life to start moving, to do something and make things happen.
Aktium is a new platform for the development of art made by artists, art enthusiasts and developers. Blockchain technology and NFTs are changing the art world scenario, so we use them to connect artists and promote their work.
With NFT sales on Cardano´s blockchain, we will collect funds to empower the development of artists' works and make them gain visibility.
That's Aktium NFTs primary use in this first era for us. We have a long term vision for this project, so we can tell that many new uses will come in the future.
This is just the beginning for Aktium.
